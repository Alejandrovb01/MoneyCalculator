# MoneyCalculator
Translates the input amount of money from one currency to another. The currencies and their values are obtained from an API that requires an access key. The access key has limited uses, so if the current one is no longer valid you can get a new one for free [here](https://fixer.io/signup/free) and update it in the FixerApiClient class.
